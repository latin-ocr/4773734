The copyriqht iaw of the united States (Titie 17, united
States Code) governs the making of the photocopies or
other reproductions of copyrighted materiai including
foreign works under certain conditions. in addition, the
United States extends protection to foreign works by
means of various internationai conventions‚ bilaterai
agreements, and proclamations.

Under certain conditions specified in the law, iibraries
and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or
other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is
that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be “used
for any purpose other than private study‚ scholar-emp, or
research.” if a user makes a request for purposes in
excess of “fair use‚” that use may be liabie for copyriqnt
infrinqement.

The institution reserves the riqnt to refuse to accept a
copy order if, in its judqrnent, fulfiiiment of the order
would involve vioiation of the copyriqnt law.
